Dutch Tax (FOSS)

A small, open tool to estimate annual Dutch taxes for Box 3 (income from savings and investments). The aim is simple, clear calculations with transparent assumptions.

Why Box 3?
Box 3 can be confusing due to assumed returns and thresholds. This project focuses on making that part easy to understand.
